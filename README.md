# Turbo Sort

This is a very fast parsing script for downloaded TV shows and movies. It will use scene-standard naming conventions (and a lot of nonstandard ones, too) to match TV shows and movies and rename / move them as you like.

My script now supports format strings similar to SABnzbd! It should also work on all platforms that have a Python interpreter available.

Since this script is written in python, you will need a python interpreter installed on your system. If you do not have one, you can get one from http://python.org/.

## Getting Started

 1. Download archive
 2. Extract somewhere
 3. Open turbo_sort.py in a text editor
 4. Edit the variables at the top of the script per the README or see below for what the options do.
 5. Save & Run the script

## Variables

* `tvdest`: Folder where TV shows will be moved to
* `moviedest`: Folder where Movies will be moved to
* `sourcedir`: The directory the script will search for files ending in an extension specified in extensions
* `extensions`: Specify which extensions to match. ex. ["mkv", "avi", "myextension", "mp4"]
* `min_size`: Files below this size, in megabytes (MB) will be ignored
* `overwrite`: Set to True to overwrite files in the destination directory with ones from the source.
* `remove_CC`: Set to True to remove country codes such as US, UK, DE, NL, BR from filenames -- specified in COUNTRIES
* `verbose`: Set to True to get command line output
* `truncate`: Set to True to enable 80-char wide output truncation
* `notify`: Set to true to enable popup notifications instead of shell output. This option supersedes truncate and verbose. (YOU MUST INSTALL PYNOTIFY TO USE THIS FUNCTION: http://home.gna.org/py-notify/)
* `stay_open`: Set to True to keep the shell window open after script has finished executi `no_rename`:
   Set to True to disable the script from performing file operations (will only display output)
