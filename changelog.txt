--------------------------
Version 2.2.4 - 6/8/2013
--------------------------
Added clean_mode option to select between "safe" and "bruteforce" cleanup methods. Safe cleanup removes files with similar names and then attempts to remove emptied folders, while bruteforce deletes folders regardless of their content unless there is another video file to move.
Removed redundant code and abstracted methods.

Version 2.2.3 - 6/4/2013
--------------------------
Added cleanup feature -- removes files with same prefix after a file is renamed (e.g. removes "show.par2" if "show.mkv' was moved) and removes empty folders afterward
Added "satellites" feature to move files such as subtitles that are associated with a renamed file (works like cleanup)
Improved 'special attributes' detection for movies (Fixed Argo.2012.extended.cut.1080p.*) 
Now acquires guest details (or misc. info) for Daily Show / Colbert Report and many others. (currently unused)
Added %o format string variable -- returns original filename

Version 2.2.2 - 2/10/2013
--------------------------
Added "min_size" feature to ignore files below a threshhold
Increased speed by replacing string.join() with +=
Removed redundant code

Version 2.2.1 - 2/3/2013
--------------------------
Fixed movie rename in format "scenegroup.the.movie.title.quality.ext" (e.g. ctf-jack.and.jill.xvid.avi -> Jack and Jill.avi)
Re-added catch-all try statement to stop script from crashing on unexpected strings.
Oops -- fixed print issue for python 3 with parens
No longer crashes if pynotify could not be found while it is enabled

Version 2.2.0 - 11/15/2012
--------------------------
Refactored code and improved comments & readability
Fixed rename on files like "The Show - S02E05.mkv"
Fixed bug where sourcedir is deleted if it is empty
New titlecaser!! Covers more cases but should run as fast
Fixed permissions error while copying between filesystems - Thanks to Saad Javed
Added popup notifications via pynotify library - Thanks to Saad Javed

Version 2.1.0 - 5/9/2012
------------------------
Adds %T (TITLE), %sm (Mar), %SM (MAR), and %FM (MARCH) format strings
Fixed really stupid overwrite 'bug'
Added stay_open and no_rename fields in addition to debug. Stay_open prompts before exit, and no_rename makes the script print output without sorting files (no file operations at all -- mainly for test)
Added an exception where the file is thought to be a non-dated show with a year, but has no season. Will now detect these files as movies.
Detects irregularly spaced quality from title in movies (e.g. Movie.Title.2007.LIMITED.1080p now works where before only Movie.Title.2007.1080p did)
Allows rename of movies without quality or year attributes, but WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FORMAT THE FILENAME, ONLY MOVES THE FILE TO MOVIE DIRECTORY. (e.g. "ctf.jack.and.jill.xvid.avi" -> dest\Ctf Jack and Jill.avi)
Added mp4 as default extension since the Scene adopted x264 for sd rips.
Improved bracket sanitization to check for mismatched right bracket.
Improve output by dynamically altering the size of the path displayed to fit on a line
Added outputfull field to prevent dynamic output size.
Removed redundant calls to index_fs()
